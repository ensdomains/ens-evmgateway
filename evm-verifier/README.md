# @ensdomains/evm-verifier
A Solidity library that verifies state proofs generated by an [evm-gateway](https://github.com/ensdomains/evmgateway/tree/main/evm-gateway) instance. This library implements all the functionality required make CCIP-Read calls to an EVM gateway and verify the responses, except for verifying the root of the proof. This library is intended to be used by libraries for specific EVM-compatible chains that implement the missing  functionality.

For a detailed readme and usage instructions, see the [monorepo readme](https://github.com/ensdomains/evmgateway/tree/main).
